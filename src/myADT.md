## Question
***

Given a collection of integers in the field [-100,100]
Write a myADT data structure that stores the numbers.
The structure will support the function:

```java
int howManyMore(int k)
```

* Returns the amount of organs in a collection whose value is k or more, at runtime O(1)
```java
void merge(myADT other)
```
* The function receives another myADT collection and consolidates it into the existing collection, at the best running time. Analyze the run time
