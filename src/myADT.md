## Question 1

Given a collection of integers in the field [-100,100]
Write a myADT data structure that stores the numbers.
The structure will support the function:

```java
int howManyMore(int k)
```
* Returns the amount of organs in a collection whose value is k or more, at runtime O(1)
```java
void merge(myADT other)
```
* The function receives another myADT collection and consolidates it into the existing collection, at the best running time. Analyze the run time

## Question 2
* Let A be an unsorted Array with n elements.
* Write a recursive function that find max and min element of A, at runtime O(n).

## Question 3
* Write an action that receives a s string and a ch.
* You must print all the different subStrings of s that start In ch, and ending at the end of the string.

example:
```aidl
s="Java is a good language" 
ch = 'a'

1. ava is a good language
2. a is a good language
3. a good language
4. anguage
5. age
```
